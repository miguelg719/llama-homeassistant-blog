Smart home technology has revolutionized how we interact with our homes, but it comes with significant trade-offs: fragmented ecosystems, privacy concerns, and a lack of truly personalized automation. What if you could have all the convenience of a smart home assistant without sacrificing your data or control? In this demo we introduce a groundbreaking integration of Home Assistant and Meta’s Llama 3.2 models delivering the world’s first private, local, and adaptive smart home assistant.

The current landscape of smart home technology is riddled with challenges:

1. **Fragmentation**: Devices from different brands rarely play well together, forcing users to juggle multiple apps and interfaces.
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Popular assistants rely on cloud-based processing, exposing your data to external servers and risking potential breaches.
3. **Lack of Personalization**: While assistants can perform basic tasks, they often fail to learn and adapt to your unique needs and habits.

These limitations create a frustrating user experience that prioritizes convenience over security and customization. Open source tools like Home Assistant, an open-source platform that connects and manages smart devices, aim to address some of these issues, but their complex setup and learning curve can deter non-technical users. By leveraging Meta’s Llama 3.2, an advanced large language model (LLM) capable of natural language processing, we’ve created a system that:

1. **Processes Locally**: All data stays on your home network, ensuring privacy and eliminating dependence on the cloud.
2. **Simplifies Smart Home Management**: Home Assistant acts as a centralized hub, unifying control of devices across brands and ecosystems whereas the Llama model allows you to control devices and create automations using intuitive voice or text commands.
3. **Learns and Adapts**: The system proactively suggests and implements automations based on your preferences and routines.

## **Try it yourself**

In this quickstart, we will guide you through the first steps of setting up the integration. We will download Home Assistant as a docker container, run through the onboarding process, start the Ollama server, and finally run a gradio frontend to interact with the Llama model. 

### **Prerequisites**

  - Docker
  - Python 3.10+
  - Ollama


### **1. Clone the repo**

You can find the repo __[here](https://github.com/miguelg719/homeassistant-llama)__.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miguelg719/homeassistant-llama
cd homeassistant-llama
```

Notice how the repo contains both a frontend/ and backend/ directory. The frontend directory contains a gradio app that allows you to interact with the backend. The backend directory contains the Home Assistant configuration together with a FastAPI server that allows you to interact with the Home Assistant API and the Llama model through Ollama.


### **2. Compose the backend**

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### **3. Onboard Home Assistant**


### **4. Paste the Home Assistant API token into your .env file**

### **5. Re-compose the backend**

```bash
docker compose up
``` 

### **6. Start the frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
python3 -m gradio app.py
```

## Key Features and Use Cases

### 1. Dynamic Automation
Combine multiple actions into a single command. For example:
- Say, “Set movie mode,” and the system dims the lights, closes the blinds, and turns on your TV.

### 2. Energy Efficiency
Automatically adjust the thermostat based on weather forecasts and occupancy, helping you save energy and reduce costs.

### 3. Home Security
Respond to commands like, “Check all doors,” by summarizing the lock status and alerting you to anomalies.

### 4. Family Routines
Simplify daily life with routines like “morning prep” that turn on lights, start the coffee maker, and play the news.

### 5. Accessibility Support
Enable hands-free control for individuals with disabilities through natural language interactions. -->
